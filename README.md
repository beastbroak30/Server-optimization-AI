# AI-Powered Server Efficiency Optimization

This project presents a **Python-based AI model** designed to enhance **server efficiency** for Microsoft data centers. The model is trained using **Google Colab** and considers various real-time environmental, operational, and human activity factors to make smart, energy-efficient decisions.

## ðŸ§  AI Case Study Overview

In large data centers, energy consumption and cooling costs are critical factors. We built an AI model that:

- Monitors **real-time metrics**
- Makes **dynamic decisions**
- Learns over time
- Controls server operations and environment adaptively

The model was trained on simulated and real-world-style datasets, taking into account various influencing factors.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Creation

To train the model effectively, we generated a dataset combining real-world-inspired synthetic values, including:

- Server logs (CPU usage, power draw, etc.)
- Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity)
- Occupancy simulation
- Time-based patterns (weekdays vs weekends, peak hours)
- AI usage simulation (e.g., workload surges during training jobs)

### Example Dataset Generation Code (Python)
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

rows = []
start_time = datetime(2025, 1, 1, 0, 0)

for i in range(10000):
    current_time = start_time + timedelta(minutes=15*i)
    row = {
        "CPU_Usage": np.random.uniform(20, 95),
        "Internal_Temp": np.random.uniform(25, 35),
        "External_Temp": np.random.uniform(20, 40),
        "External_Humidity": np.random.uniform(30, 80),
        "Power_Draw": np.random.uniform(80, 150),
        "Solar_Wind": np.random.uniform(0, 100),
        "Grid_Price": np.random.uniform(0.1, 0.3),
        "Occupancy": np.random.randint(0, 50),
        "Day": current_time.strftime("%A"),
        "Hour": current_time.hour,
        "Active_Users": np.random.randint(1000, 5000),
        "AI_Task_Load": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"])
    }
    rows.append(row)

pd.DataFrame(rows).to_csv("dataset.csv", index=False)
```
